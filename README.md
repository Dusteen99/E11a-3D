There are three different parts of the project.

The first part is simply a cube but into a 3D scene with some lighting.

The second part is a piece of land with some crates stacked on it. There is also a camera that spins around, showing the shadows from the directional lighting.

The last part is a controllable 3D platformer with a simple level and character controls in first person.
